A few conclustions can be made from the results;
  - Rural cities have lowest number of rides and drivers however have the largest fare per ride and per driver. 
  - Urban cities have the highest number of drivers, almost 5 times more than suburban and 30 times more than       rural cities and such have the lowest average fare per driver. 
  - With the population density and higher volumes of rides, PyBer makes the most fares from urban cities almost     double from that of suburban cities and 10 times from that of rural cities.

## Summary

In summary, here are a few recommendations to the CEO based on the results obtained;
  - More investment is needed in rural places to take advantage of the high average fare per driver, making sure not to have too many drivers fighting for the same customers. 
  - January seems to be the slowest month and average fares tend to increase as the summer approaches, by reducing the amount of drivers in the winter months, to can save on costs 
  - Suburban cities seem to be a good middle ground between the low populated rural areas and high density, high competition ubran areas, thus presenting a good opportunity to expand services and create more investments where public transport is lacking
